// I'll create a comprehensive list of all lines that need to be changed in calculator.js
// Lines with isDisabled that should be removed:
// 77, 83, 88, 94, 105, 110, 111
// Lines with disabled property in breakdown items:
// 141, 157, 172, 215, 227, 240

// Instead of making many small edits, I should do a more comprehensive replacement
